## Subagent Constraints (Hard Rules)

1. CANNOT spawn subagents — Agent tool removed
2. CANNOT ask user questions — AskUserQuestion removed
3. CANNOT enter plan mode — EnterPlanMode removed
4. Isolated context window per subagent (size = model-dependent)
5. System prompt = `.md` body (NOT full Claude Code system prompt)
6. Windows: long `.md` may fail via `--agents` CLI (8191 char limit)

**Exception** — `claude --agent`: agents ARE main thread, CAN spawn subagents + restrict types

## Orchestrator-as-Skill Pattern

Skills run in main conversation where Agent tool IS available → orchestrate specialists w/o nested-subagent constraint.

```

```yaml
---
name: code-write
description: >
  Use when implementing features, writing code, adding functionality,
  building components, or creating new files. Orchestrates language-specific
  code writers for cross-layer features. MUST be invoked for any code
  generation task.
context: fork

```

```markdown
## Orchestrator Protocol

1. **Analyze the request** — what kind of feature? What layers affected?
2. **Load pipeline trace** — read references/pipeline-traces.md
3. **Map file changes** — which files need to be created/modified?
4. **Determine specialists** — which language agents needed?
5. **Check file ownership** — no two agents should edit the same file
6. **Dispatch specialists** — in dependency order (data layer first, UI last)
7. **Verify integration** — build all, run tests, check cross-layer wiring
```

## Agent YAML Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: code-writer-dotnet
description: >
  .NET/C# code writer specialist. Use when writing C# code for FastEndpoints
  APIs, EF Core entities/configurations, services, DTOs, mappers, or any
  .cs file. Knows project conventions, DI patterns, error handling.
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, LSP, WebSearch
model: sonnet
effort: medium

```

| Field | Req | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `name` | Y | Lowercase hyphens, <64 chars |
| `description` | Y | Pushy — trigger words for when to use |
| `tools` / `disallowedTools` | N | Allow/denylist; default: inherit |
| `model` | N | `haiku` `sonnet` `opus`; default: inherit |
| `effort` | N | `low` `medium` `high` `max`; default: inherit |
| `maxTurns` | N | Limit iterations |
| `color` | N | CLI output color |
| `memory` | N | `user` `project` `local` |
| `skills` | N | Preloaded (full SKILL.md injected) |
| `isolation` | N | `worktree` for git isolation |
| `permissionMode` | N | `default` `acceptEdits` `dontAsk` `plan` |
| `background` | N | **Do not use** — see Foreground-Only |
| `hooks` / `mcpServers` | N | Lifecycle hooks; MCP servers |
| `scope` | N | Comma-separated framework/concern list; used by orchestrators for sub-specialist routing |
| `parent` | N | Name of parent agent this sub-specialist was split from; prevents re-splitting |

**Skill authoring** (Anthropic docs): description third-person max 1024 chars; body <500 lines (split to `references/`); refs one level deep; TOC for >100-line files; project-specific only ("would Claude get this wrong?"); match freedom to fragility; validate→fix→repeat loops; test 3+ scenarios before writing docs

**Model selection:** GENERATES code | SUBTLE errors → `opus`; ANALYZES → `sonnet`; CHECKS → `haiku`

| Agent | Model | Agent | Model |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| code-writer-{lang} | opus | plan-writer | sonnet |
| code-writer-{lang}-{fw} | opus | | |
| test-writer | opus | researcher | sonnet |
| project-code-reviewer | opus | consistency-checker | sonnet |
| debugger | opus | verifier | sonnet |
| tdd-runner / reflector | opus | quick-check | haiku |

## Foreground-Only Dispatch

**Always foreground. Never `run_in_background: true`.** Permission-gated tools silently block background agents. Parallel foreground (multiple Agent calls in one message) = same concurrency.
- Permission-gated: `Write` `Edit` `Bash` `NotebookEdit` `Agent` `WebSearch` `WebFetch`
- Auto-allowed: `Read` `Grep` `Glob` `LSP`

| Restriction | Tools | Use for |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Minimal | `Read, Grep, Glob` | reviewers, researchers |
| Standard | `Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, LSP` | implementation |
| Extended | Standard + `WebSearch, WebFetch` | current docs/APIs |
| Orchestrator | `Agent(...), Read, Grep, Glob, Bash` | main-thread only |

## Communication + Errors + Teams

**Communication:** file-based (most reliable) | task-based (teams only) | sequential (A→B→synthesize) | parallel (no deps → single message)

**Errors:** check output → retry ONCE w/ context → surface to user; never swallow. Prevention: verification steps; maxTurns; "if unsure, say so"

**Teams** = independent full sessions (unlike subagents). Own context + tools.

| Criteria | Subagents | Teams |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Scope | Focused | Complex |
| Context | <50% window | Full window |
| Coordination | Dispatch | Shared tasks |
| Cost | 4-7x | ~15x |
| Isolation | Shared repo | Worktree |

Avoid teams for: simple tasks; cost-sensitive; tight sequential coordination

## Invocation Quality (Critical)

Most failures = poor invocations. Bad:
```
"Fix the Division service"
```

Good:
```
"In MyProject.Services/Data/Divisions/DivisionService.cs,
add a new method `GetActiveDivisionsForBrandAsync(Guid brandId)` that:
1. Queries divisions where BrandId == brandId AND IsActive == true
2. Uses AsNoTracking() (read-only query)
3. Returns Task<List<Division>>
4. Follows the existing pattern in GetDivisionsByBrandAsync (line 45)
5. Uses IDataService<AppDbContext>.Entity<Division, Guid>().WhereAsQueryable()

Reference files:
- Current service: Services/Data/Divisions/DivisionService.cs
- Interface: Services/Data/Divisions/IDivisionService.cs (add to interface too)
- Pattern example: Services/Data/Brands/BrandService.cs:GetActiveBrandsAsync

After implementation, run: dotnet build MyProject.Services"
```

Checklist: file paths; success criteria; reference files; build/test command; unexpected-case instructions

## Turn-Efficient Agent Design

Turn count = second cost axis. Each turn re-reads conversation → turn reduction × token compression = multiplicative.

### Pre-Computed Context
Front-load context orchestrator already has — don't make agent discover it.

**Bad — forces discovery turns:**
```
"Write an article about the trend in the database"
```

**Good — eliminates discovery turns:**
```
"Write an article about {trend_title}.

Research data (pre-computed by researcher job):
{yaml block with key_facts, sources, angles}

Brand voice rules are pre-loaded in context (cron/shared/brand-voice-rules.md).
Do NOT re-read them. Do NOT search for additional brand guidance.

Target: 800-1200 words, Czech, publish-ready.
Output: JSON with title, body, meta_description, slug."
```

Pipeline: `pre_commands` compute+inject; `include_files` for static refs; stage outputs = YAML injected directly

### Search Batching for Research Agents

```markdown
## Research Protocol
1. Identify ALL information needs before searching
2. Execute all WebSearch calls in ONE message (parallel)
3. After receiving results, identify specific gaps
4. At most ONE follow-up batch
5. Maximum 2 search rounds total
```

### Tool Call Batching Instruction
Include in every multi-tool prompt — agents, orchestrator skills, CI prompts, cron prompts (Anthropic-recommended XML pattern):

```markdown
<use_parallel_tool_calls>
For maximum efficiency, invoke all independent tool calls simultaneously
rather than sequentially. Err on the side of maximizing parallel calls.
- Multiple Reads → batch in one message
- Multiple Greps → batch in one message
- Multiple WebSearches → batch in one message
- Read-only commands (ls, Glob, Grep) → ALWAYS parallel
NEVER: Read A → respond → Read B → respond. INSTEAD: Read A + B → respond.
</use_parallel_tool_calls>
```

Compact form (short prompts, CI/cron):
```markdown
<use_parallel_tool_calls>true</use_parallel_tool_calls>
Batch all independent tool calls into one message.
```

Full block: multi-step workflow, nuanced batching rules needed.
Compact: prompt is brief; single instruction sufficient.

XML tag = behavioral anchor — stronger than markdown headers.

### Agent SDK: Tool Result Formatting
Parallel batch results MUST go in **single** user message. Splitting trains model away from parallelism.

```json
[
  {"role": "assistant", "content": ["tool_use_1", "tool_use_2"]},
  {"role": "user", "content": ["tool_result_1"]},
  {"role": "user", "content": ["tool_result_2"]}
]
```

```json
[
  {"role": "assistant", "content": ["tool_use_1", "tool_use_2"]},
  {"role": "user", "content": ["tool_result_1", "tool_result_2"]}
]
```

No text before tool_results; every `tool_use` needs matching `tool_result`; collect all before next message.

### Batch Operations (Script Threshold)

>5 homogeneous ops (rename 10 files, patch 8 agents, update 12 configs) → write script, execute in one Bash call. <=5 ops OR heterogeneous → parallel tool calls.

BAD: 10× individual Read calls for 10 config files
GOOD: one Bash `for f in configs/*.yaml; do cat "$f"; done`

Threshold = IDENTICAL operations. Mixed read+write+grep = parallel tool calls, not script.

### Tool Use Examples (Reduce Misuse)

Include wrong/right examples in agent templates for tool-misuse-prone patterns. Inline examples reduce correction loops more than rule statements alone.

BAD: Read file-a.md → respond → Read file-b.md → respond (2 turns)
GOOD: Read file-a.md + Read file-b.md → respond once (1 turn)

BAD: Bash `grep -r foo .` (shell grep instead of Grep tool)
GOOD: Grep tool w/ pattern="foo" (optimized permissions + access)

### Meta-Tools / Pre-Commands

| Pattern | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Agent greps for compliance rules → reads them → applies | pre_command runs compliance check, injects result |
| Agent reads DB → filters → processes | pre_command runs SQL query, injects filtered data |
| Agent reads 3 files to learn pattern | Inline pattern example in prompt |
| Agent searches web for same reference each run | Cache result, inject as include_file |

Sequence in >50% runs → extract to pre_command | include_file.

### Turn Budget Guidelines

```markdown
## Efficiency Expectations
- Research phase: batch all searches (aim for 2 search rounds max)
- Writing phase: produce complete draft in 1-2 turns
- Verification phase: self-fix up to 3 attempts before reporting
- Total: minimize turns. Every tool call should have clear purpose.
```

Mechanical jobs: hard `maxTurns` (5-10) — deterministic.

## File Size + Token Efficiency

| Lines | Action |
|-------|--------|
| <100 | Too sparse — may lack context |
| 100-300 | Ideal |
| 300-500 | Acceptable for complex projects |
| 500+ | Split into agent + `references/` |

```
.claude/agents/code-writer-dotnet.md          # Core logic (200 lines)
.claude/agents/references/dotnet-patterns.md   # Detailed examples (300 lines)
```

Agent `.md` = system prompts — Claude only reader. Compress w/ telegraphic notation (`techniques/prompt-engineering.md` → Token Optimization). Code examples → full fidelity. 30-50% smaller × invocation count.
